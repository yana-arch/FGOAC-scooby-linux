# FGOAC scooby {{VERSION}} - FGO Arcade in English

An English patch for the FGO Arcade local platform. It puts the game itself into English - menus,
tutorial, story text, battle screens, shops, help - and replaces the Chinese front end with an
English one called **FGOAC scooby**, which starts the server, manages your account and builds your
card deck.

This is not a game download. It does nothing on its own: you need an existing FGO Arcade local
platform install (Cloud23333's package at V1.01 or V1.02; V1.02 is the one to be on), and the patch
is applied on top of it.

## Install

### Windows
1. Unzip this package into your FGO Arcade folder - the one that holds `App` and `Server`.
2. Run **FGOAC scooby.exe**.
3. Click Yes on the Windows permission prompt.

### Linux (Lutris / Proton)
1. Unzip this package into your FGO Arcade folder beside `App` and `Server`.
2. Run `./linux/setup-fgoa-linux.sh` to configure network and Proton shims.
3. Open Lutris, set up the game profile using `linux/fgolocalplatform.lutris.yml`, and press **Play**! See `LINUX_GUIDE.md` for complete details.

The first start does the rest: it installs the English files, checks that the game can write to its
folders, allows the game and the local server through Windows Firewall, creates the account
**Master** with a full Servant and Craft Essence roster, and sets the display to windowed 1280x720
on your main monitor. Then press **Play**. The game needs about a minute to reach the title screen.

If the firewall rules could not be created - a company policy or security suite can block that -
Windows asks you instead the first time you press Play: once for the local server
(`Server\python\python.exe`) and once for the game (`App\ago.exe`). Allow both. Those Windows
questions can open **behind** the game window, so if the game seems stuck at a black screen, look
for them in the task bar.

Later starts skip all of that and go straight to Play.

**GUIDE_EN.pdf** (and **LINUX_GUIDE.md** for Linux players) in this folder is the full guide: requirements, how to get Servants, controls, the
exchange shops, and troubleshooting.

Three things to know before you start:

- **The game cannot run from drive E: or Y:.** Its own file hook sends every path on those drives to
  the cabinet data mount, and the game stops with ERROR 4104. Any other drive is fine.
- **The game has to run as administrator.** That is the one Windows prompt you cannot skip; without
  it the game shows ERROR 4105 about ninety seconds after boot.
- **The game needs a CPU with F16C.** Intel Core 3rd generation (2012) or newer, and any Ryzen, has
  it; older Pentium and Celeron chips do not, and the game stops with 0xC000001D at start. There is
  no fix on that CPU.

If you would rather install the files without the launcher, run `Apply-EN-Patch.ps1` yourself - it
takes `-InstallRoot`, and `-Rollback` puts back everything it replaced. Once you are happy with the
install you can delete `payload\`, `Apply-EN-Patch.ps1` and `manifest.json` to get the space back,
but keep them if you may want to roll back later.

## What works

- The game text: 65,266 translated lines - story, quests, Servant profiles, skills, items, menus.
- The game artwork: 240 rebuilt sprite archives - title, tutorial, terminal, formation, battle HUD,
  results, shops, synthesis, present box, master missions, rankings, help pages, title editor.
- The launcher: Play, Account, Cards and Deck, Settings and Advanced, all in English, with the
  official English card names and Craft Essence effects in the card library.
- Offline single player: the tutorial, solo sorties, the terminal, the exchange shops, synthesis,
  My Room, rankings and the title editor.
- The in-game summon, drawing from the local server with the weights set on the launcher's Draw
  Rates page. The Account page can also grant a full roster in one click.

## What does not work

- **No online play.** Everything runs against the local server; there is no matchmaking and no
  official service to connect to.
- **A few event screens are still Japanese**: the co-op event banners, the co-op result screens and
  the later event shops. They are artwork, not text, and the rest of the game is unaffected.
- The game is built for NVIDIA cards and wants a current driver; a black screen usually means the
  driver, not the patch. On AMD and Intel graphics the launcher turns on the bundled compatibility
  layer by fluphus by itself (Settings > Display, "AMD and Intel compatibility layer"); he tested it
  on an RX 7900 XTX at 1920x1080 only, with a 60 fps cap.

## Reporting a problem

Say which screen you were on and what you expected, and attach the log files from the `logs` folder
next to `App`:

| File | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| `fgo-last-launch.log` | the launch script, from start to exit code |
| `fgozh.log` | the English file hook: which files the game actually loaded |
| `server-control.log`, `artemis-stderr.log`, `mariadb.log` | the local server and its database |
| `environment-check.txt` | the environment check, written by the Diagnostics and Help page |

**Advanced > Diagnostics and Help** in the launcher lists the game's error codes with the fix for
each one; check it first, the answer is usually there.

## Credits

- **Cloud23333** wrote the FGO Arcade local platform - the server package, the launcher
  (`FGOLocalPlatform`) that FGOAC scooby is built from, and the file hook this patch loads its English
  through. None of this exists without his work. His package is free; if anyone sold it to you, ask
  for your money back.
- The **FGO Arcade wiki** and **Atlas Academy** were used for the official English names of
  Servants, Craft Essences, skills and items, so the game and the launcher call everything what the
  English release calls it.
- FGO Arcade is Sega's and TYPE-MOON's. This is a fan translation, applied to files you already
  have, and it is not sold.
